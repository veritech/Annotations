h1. CakePHP Annotation Plugin

h2. What
A solution for making textual notes on any record in your application

h2. Why

So now you have notesA and notesB, but then you have another model that needs ...

I'm sure you see where this is going. So this is the solution, 
a generic plugin to allow you to add annotations to any model with integer based primary key.

h2. How
Well it's magical you see, i could tell you, or you could clone the project and hack it to bits ^_^
