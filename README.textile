h1. CakePHP Annotation Plugin

h2. What

A solution for making textual notes on any record in your application

h2. Why

So you have a bunch of records, and you went to annotate them. Easy, make a comment model and go nuts. 

But then you have you have another bunch of records that need annotating ... so just make another notes model.

So now you have notesA and notesB, but then you have another model that needs ...

I'm sure you see where this is going. So this is the solution, 
a generic plugin to allow you to add annotations to any model with integer based primary key.

h2. How

Well it's magical you see, i could tell you, or you could clone the project and hack it to bits ^_^
